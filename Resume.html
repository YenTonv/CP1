        <h2>PROJECTS</h2>

        <h3>Sorting Algorithms Experiment (February 2023)</h3>
        <p>
            With a team of 4, created algorithms for 12 sorting methods and tested their efficiencies using Java. We used the project output to determine which sort performed the fastest and if it aligned with our initial theory. I created algorithms for selection sort, bucket sort, and bubble sort. My work fulfilled the assignment requirements and contributed to an A grade.
        </p>

        <h3>Social Media Tracker (February 2022)</h3>
        <p>
            With a team of 4, created a database with queries, stored functions, and stored procedures using MySQL to track the extent of social mediaâ€™s influence on user choices. I wrote stored functions and stored procedures for the project, which improved code efficiency. 
        </p>

        <h3>PetCare (September 2021)</h3>
        <p>
            With a team of 4, created a project management plan using agile methodology for a fictional pet care app. The plan includes a project charter, scope, risk register, capacity planner, and budget. My work significantly contributed to the project's success, earning us an A grade.
